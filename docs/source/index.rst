Welcome to the ARGERO Portable app teaching resource centre!
===================================

Welcome to the **ARGEO Portable** app teaching resource centre! ARGEO Portable is an app that combines geography teaching resources with terrain shaping to simulate a realistic 3D geographic environment. The new version also includes a class management system that separates teacher and student accounts, and all created space is stored in the cloud system, which requires an internet connection for use. Teachers can share the screen to ZOOM/GOOGLE MEET and other distance learning applications to help them to conduct distance learning.
