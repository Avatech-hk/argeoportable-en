My Class
===================================

My Class Features
-----------------------
"My Class" allows the teacher to create a class, create a blackboard (notes) and assignments in the class, and then assign student accounts to view the blackboard and work on the assignments. At the same time, the teacher can view the assignments and My Space of the students in the class. Teachers can create multiple classes and assign different students to different classes, and student accounts can be added to multiple classes at the same time. Each teacher account can view all the boards and assignments belonging to the licensed class, while student accounts can only view the boards and assignments of the classes they have joined.

Assignment
-----------------------
Introduction to Assignments
"Assignments" allows teachers to create a space for students to do assignments. Teachers can create an assignment space first, then write the title and requirements in the space information, and edit the starting space for the assignment in advance. When the teacher chooses to publish the assignment, students in the class will be able to view the new assignment, and the starting space in the assignment is the one that the teacher has edited for the assignment in advance.

Note that when the teacher posts an assignment, the teacher can only edit the information in the workspace, not the contents of the workspace (e.g., terrain, icons, etc.).

Students can edit their workspace. Each student's work will be stored in their own account, and the teacher will be able to view all the students' work in the class after they have completed their work, but they cannot edit it.

The teacher can change the status of the assignment to "Unpublished" after publishing the assignment, so that students can no longer view or edit the assignment, but the teacher can still view the students' space in the assignment.
