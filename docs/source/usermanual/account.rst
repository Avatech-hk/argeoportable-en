**Calculation of license Usage**
**Number of Users**
The number of users depends on the license scheme, which are the number of teacher users and the number of student users.
The number of teacher users is calculated based on the successful activation of the license by the teacher account, and is not counted if the teacher account leaves the license.
The number of student users is calculated based on the number of classes a student account successfully joins, even if a student account joins more than one class it will only take up one student user number, if the student account leaves the license, it will not be counted.

**More information**：My Classes - Teacher Accounts - Leave license；My Classes - Teacher Accounts - Remove Student license Permissions
Space Usage
Space usage is based on the license plan, and is the amount of space used by the teacher and the amount of space used by the student. If the occupied space usage is full, no new space can be created in the account.

Teacher space usage is based on the total number of spaces in ‘My Space’, ‘Blackboard’ and ‘Assignments’. Space usage is calculated based on space already created in the account and is not shared with other teacher accounts.

Student space usage is calculated for My Space and Assignments.

- My Space: Space usage is calculated on the space created in the account.

- Blackboard: Space usage is not calculated.

- Assignments: Space usage is calculated based on the number of assignments in the account. Since the assignments are created in the class from the teacher's account, if the teacher creates an assignment, the space usage for each student in the class will be increased by one. If a student's space usage is full, a new assignment created by the teacher can still be assigned to the student whose space usage is full, and the student will still be able to save the assignment. However, students can no longer create space in My Space, and the student's space usage will be shown as exceeded.
