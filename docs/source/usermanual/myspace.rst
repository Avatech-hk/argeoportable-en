My Space
===================================

My Space Features

"My Space" allows users to create a personalised terrain space where you can use all the editing features, including terrain shaping, drawing tools, marking tools, and the map interface, etc. The space will be saved in your account. Teacher accounts can view the My Spaces of the students in their license class, but cannot edit the students' spaces. Teacher or student accounts cannot view another teacher's My Space, even if the accounts are under the same license. Student accounts must be enrolled in a class to use My Space.
